Problem Statement

Patients who take multiple medicines daily often forget their scheduled doses due to busy routines, irregular timing, or lack of a proper reminder system. Missing medicines may reduce treatment effectiveness, cause health complications, and increase hospital visits.
A simple, accessible system is needed that can store prescriptions, track medicine timings, and provide timely reminders without requiring internet or complex applications.

Scope of the Project

This project focuses on building a lightweight command-line based Medicine Reminder & Prescription Tracker that:

Stores medicine details such as name, dosage, and daily reminder times

Allows users to view or delete prescriptions

Continuously checks the system time to provide alerts

Uses persistent JSON storage for offline use

Provides a simple, menu-driven interface suitable for all users

The project does not include advanced analytics, push notifications, or multi-user profiles (these may be added as future enhancements).

Target Users

Individuals who need reminders for taking daily medications

Elderly users who require simple, non-technical tools

Chronic patients who follow strict medicine schedules

Students or caregivers managing prescriptions of family members

Anyone who wants a basic offline reminder tool without installing apps

High-Level Features

Add prescriptions with medicine name, dosage, and reminder times
